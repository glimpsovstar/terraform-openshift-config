                            of pods into each bucket. We define a domain as a particular

                            is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain
                            of that topology. It's a required field.

                            is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread
                            as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P P |   P   |   P   |

                            is less than 5(MinDomains), so \"global minimum\" is treated
                            as 0. In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector
                            cannot be scheduled, because computed skew will be 3(3

                            treats \"global minimum\" as 0, and then the calculation
                            of Skew is performed. And when the number of eligible

                            than minDomains, this value has no effect on scheduling.
                            As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less
                            than minDomains, scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew

                            must be DoNotSchedule. \n For example, in a 3-zone cluster,
                            MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with
                            the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/2: | zone1 | zone2
                            | zone3 | |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  | The number of domains
                            is less than 5(MinDomains), so \"global minimum\" is treated
                            as 0. In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector
                            cannot be scheduled, because computed skew will be 3(3
                            - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                            it will violate MaxSkew. \n This is a beta field and requires

                            it is the maximum permitted difference between the number
                            of matching pods in the target topology and the global
                            minimum. The global minimum is the minimum number of matching
                            pods in an eligible domain or zero if the number of eligible
                            domains is less than MinDomains. For example, in a 3-zone
                            cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector
                            spread as 2/2/1: In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | |  P P  |  P P  |   P   | -
                            if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to
                            zone3 to become 2/2/2; scheduling it onto zone1(zone2)
                            would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2) violate
                            MaxSkew(1). - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled
                            onto any zone. When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`,
                            it is used to give higher precedence to topologies that
                            satisfy it. It''s a required field. Default value is 1
                            and 0 is not allowed.'

                            domains. When the number of eligible domains with matching
                            topology keys is less than minDomains, Pod Topology Spread
                            treats \"global minimum\" as 0, and then the calculation
                            of Skew is performed. And when the number of eligible
                            domains with matching topology keys equals or greater
                            than minDomains, this value has no effect on scheduling.
                            As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less
                            than minDomains, scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew
                            Pods to those domains. If value is nil, the constraint
                            behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1. Valid values are
                            integers greater than 0. When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable
                            must be DoNotSchedule. \n For example, in a 3-zone cluster,
                            MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with
                            the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/2: | zone1 | zone2
                            | zone3 | |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  | The number of domains
                            is less than 5(MinDomains), so \"global minimum\" is treated
                            as 0. In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector
                            cannot be scheduled, because computed skew will be 3(3
                            - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                            it will violate MaxSkew. \n This is a beta field and requires
